## KNOWN ISSUE (Ale only System)
- Must run music_analyzer in sudo without virtualenv due to permission problems
  > ghoul@Tokyo:~/Documents/GitHub/MusicAnalysis/Music_Analysis$ sudo python3 music_parser.py
  
- Chord Droid isn't up to date with Gradle
> Change instruction from their ReadMe to:

> In dependencies (gradle for the module):
`api fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.aar'])`

> In repopsitories (gradle for the module): 

`repositories{
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
}`
